# ðŸŽž mpv.net

mpv.net is a modern media player for Windows that works just like [mpv](https://mpv.io).

#### Graphical User Interface

Modern GUI that supports customizable color themes.

#### Command Line Interface

mpv.net has the [CLI of mpv](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options).

#### High quality video output

libmpv has an OpenGL based video output that is capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high quality algorithms, color management, frame timing, interpolation, HDR, and more.

#### On Screen Controller

The OSC of libmpv offers play controls with a modern flat design. ([Screenshot](#main-window-screenshot))

#### GPU video decoding

libmpv leverages the FFmpeg hwaccel APIs to support DXVA2 video decoding acceleration.

#### Active development

mpv.net is under active development. Want a feature? Post a [patch](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/pulls) or [request it](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/issues)!

#### Based on libmpv

mpv.net is based on libmpv which offers a straightforward C API that was designed from the ground up to make mpv usable as a library and facilitate easy integration into other applications. mpv is like vlc not based on DirectShow or Media Foundation.

### Installation

mpv.net requires minimum .NET Framework 4.8 and Windows 7. For optimal results a modern graphics card is recommended.

Stable releases are compiled from the source and can be downloaded from the releases tab:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/releases>

Scoop can be used to install and update it:

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install mpv.net
```
If you instead use AppGet:

`appget install mpv-net`

Alternatively, Chocolatey can also be used:

`choco install mpvnet.install`

### Manual

[Manual](Manual.md)

### Context Menu

The context menu can be customized via input.conf file located in the config directory:

```Text
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\mpv\input.conf
```

if it's missing mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/blob/master/mpv.net/Resources/inputConf.txt>

input.conf defines mpv's key and mouse bindings and mpv.net uses comments to define the context menu.

### Settings

When mpv.net finds no config folder on startup it will ask for a location.

If a folder named portable_config next to the mpvnet.exe exists,
all config will be loaded from this folder only.

```Text
<startup>\portable_config\
```

mpv specific settings are stored in the file mpv.conf, if no mpv.conf file exists
mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/blob/master/mpv.net/Resources/mpvConf.txt>

mpv.net specific settings are stored in the file mpvnet.conf

The input (key/mouse) bindings and the context menu definitions are stored in the
input.conf file, if it's missing mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/blob/master/mpv.net/Resources/inputConf.txt>

mpv.net supports almost all mpv settings and features,
[limitations are listed in the wiki](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/wiki/Limitations).

The config folder can be opened from the context menu.

### Extensions

### Architecture

Coding mpv.net was great fun because libmpv is such a awesome
library with a very clever design, I'm having a great experience
with libmpv.

The player does not contain any feature that was more work than 1-2 days or
was difficult to build, the hard parts are totally covered by libmpv.

mpv.net is written in C# 7 and runs on .NET 4.8, I've not yet decided
if I will port it to C# 8 and .NET 5 once available.

The Extension implementation is based on the [Managed Extensibility Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/).

There are no specific extension or scripting interfaces but instead everyting
is accessible for .NET compatible languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, Python, PowerShell),
this decision was made to keep the code simple and lightweight.

Python scripting is implemented with IronPython which uses Python 2.7.

The main window is WinForms based and uses less than 800 lines of code,
all other windows are WPF based and use even less code.

The config editor adds it's controls dynamically and uses [TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) to define it's
content, there are only two simple types, StringSetting and OptionSetting.

mpv.net was started 2017 and consists of about 7000 lines of code and markup.

IDE, Editor: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code.

Due to mpv.net being my first WPF app and mpv.net never meant to be a large
application best practices and design pattern are not always applied.
